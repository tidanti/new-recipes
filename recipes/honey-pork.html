    <p>This is a quick and easy recipe for pork chops in a flavorful honey-garlic sauce.</p>

    <ul>
        <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <li>4 (5 ounce) pork chops</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup honey</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Season pork chops with salt, pepper, and garlic powder on both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat until hot.<br>
            Sear pork chops until golden brown and cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and melt butter in the pan juices, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.<br>
            Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add honey, water, and vinegar.<br>
            Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally until sauce has reduced down and slightly thickened, 3 to 4 minutes.<br>
            Return pork back to the skillet and baste generously with the sauce.</li>
        <li>Transfer skillet under the broiler and broil until edges of pork chops are slightly charred, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
